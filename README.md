## Thoughts & Credits
I had a lot of fun while building this app within the context of [Alex Bank](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/alex-banks)'s class [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Flearning-redux%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url). 
A great starting point to explore and become fluent with the React & Redux ecosystem.
